# Earthquake Scenario Loss Testing 

This repository provides a set of OpenQuake-engine input files required to run past earthquake scenarios for the testing of risk models. These scenarios can be run using either earthquake rupture models or ShakeMaps. 

In order to run the scenarios in this repository you will need to download the 'esrm20_openquake' repository from which the Vs30 files (for rupture scenario calculations) and the exposure models will be read. This repository will be available from 16th December 2021. 

The 'testing_scenarios.xlsx' file summarises these events, and includes the assumptions used in the rupture sources models as well as openly available damage and loss data that can be compared with the results of the scenario calculations. 

If you have any questions or feedback on the data included in this repository, please send it via email to 'efehr.risk@sed.ethz.ch'.
